# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

**Pd-studios** (`git@github.com:Rckdrigo/Pd-studios.git`) — a collection of Pure Data (Pd) patches for live audio performance, synthesis experiments, MIDI/OSC bridging, and OpenGL visuals. There is no build system or test suite: `.pd` files are plain-text patch definitions loaded and run in the Pd GUI. "Running" a patch means opening it in Pd; editing means either dragging objects in the GUI or hand-editing the `.pd` text.

## Running Patches

Pd is installed as **Pd 0.55.2** (`/Applications/Pd-0.55.2.app`) and aliased in the shell:

```bash
pd patch.pd            # open a patch (starts DSP-capable GUI)
pd -nogui -batch x.pd  # headless run
pdsend <port>          # send messages to a running patch's netreceive
pdreceive <port>       # receive messages a patch sends via netsend
```

To find/load the bundled externals, add the relevant `externals/*` folders to Pd's search path (Preferences → Paths) or launch with `-path`, e.g. `pd -path externals/Gem visuals-studio.pd`.

## The .pd File Format (for hand-editing)

Every patch is a sequence of `;`-terminated records:
- `#N canvas <x> <y> <w> <h> <fontsize>;` — opens a canvas (window or subpatch).
- `#X obj <x> <y> <objname> <args...>;` — an object box. GUI objects (`hsl`, `vsl`, `tgl`, `bng`, `scope`, `floatatom`) carry a long fixed argument list for size/range/colors.
- `#X msg`, `#X text`, `#X floatatom` — message boxes, comments, number boxes.
- `#X connect <src-obj-idx> <src-outlet> <dst-obj-idx> <dst-inlet>;` — a patch cord. **Object indices are the 0-based order in which `#X obj`/`#X msg`/etc. records appear in the file.** Inserting or reordering an object shifts every later index, so any hand-edit that adds/removes an object must renumber all affected `#X connect` lines. Prefer editing in the Pd GUI when connections are involved.
- `#X coords ...` at the end of an abstraction defines its graph-on-parent appearance (visible when the abstraction is instantiated inside another patch).

## Conventions in this repo

- **`tools/`** holds reusable **abstractions** (`PI.pd`, `circunference.pd`, `max-value.pd`, `min-value.pd`, `step.pd`) — small patches meant to be dropped into others as `[abstraction-name]` object boxes rather than run standalone. Add new shared building blocks here.
- **Audio files are gitignored** (`*.mp3`, `*.wav`, `*.ogg`) — sampler patches reference audio that lives outside version control; don't assume a referenced sample is present.
- `Untitled-*.pd`, `test*.pd`, `estudio-*.pd`, `studio-*.pd`, `workshop.pd` are experimental scratch patches. The named patches below are the deliberate ones.

## Machine-specific I/O (patches assume this hardware routing)

Several patches address **specific channels of a multichannel audio interface** by number — they will be silent or misrouted on a stereo-only setup. When editing these, preserve the channel numbers unless the hardware changed.

- **`blackhole-map.pd`** — an abstraction that maps hardware `adc~` inputs to named outlets: ch 10 = Mic L, 13/14 = MK L/R, 11/12 = SC L/R, 15/16 = Music L/R, 20/21 extra. Used as the input router for performance patches.
- **`minilab.pd` / `minilab-enter.pd` / `ml-*.pd`** — Arturia **MiniLab** MIDI-controller patches; read `adc~ 13/14`, output on `dac~ 5/6`.
- **`midi-osc-bridge.pd`** — converts MIDI CC (`ctlin`) to OSC and sends via `netsend -u -b` to `localhost:6010` (SuperCollider/Tidal-style receiver). CC value is scaled `/127`.
- **`performance-1.pd`, `visuals-studio.pd`** — larger performance/visual sets; `visuals-studio.pd` uses the **Gem** external for OpenGL rendering.

## Bundled externals (`externals/`)

Not authored here — vendored binaries/help, kept out of the normal edit surface:
- **Gem** — OpenGL graphics rendering (`gemwin`, geometry, shaders); required by the visuals patches. Ships macOS `.dylib`/`.d_fat` binaries and an `examples/` tree.
- **PureDirt-master** — Dirt-style sample playback objects.
- **comport** — serial port I/O.
- **freeverb~** — reverb.

The former `externals/purest_json` (REST/JSON/OAuth objects) has been removed from the working tree.
